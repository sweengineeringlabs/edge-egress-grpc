/// `Status(GrpcStatusCode, String)` is the canonical variant for a
/// well-formed gRPC reply that carried a non-`Ok` status code.  The
/// string is a *sanitized* message suitable to surface to callers and
/// must not contain server-side stack traces or internal paths.  See
/// `core::status_codes` for the wire ↔ enum mapping.
///
/// `ConnectionFailed`, `Timeout`, `Unavailable`, `Cancelled`, and
/// `Internal` are transport-level conditions that occur *before*
/// the server returns a status (or after the local timeout fires).
