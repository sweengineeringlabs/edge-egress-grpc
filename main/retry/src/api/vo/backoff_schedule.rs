//! Backoff schedule outcome type.
//!
//! The implementation lives in `core/backoff_scheduler/`. This file
//! holds the public type that `core/backoff_scheduler/` produces — a
//! [`BackoffSchedule`] descriptor — so the layer-boundary check
//! can find an api/ counterpart for every core/ submodule.

use std::time::Duration;

/// Outcome of one call to the backoff scheduler.
///
/// Construct via the helpers in `core/backoff_scheduler/` — consumers
/// outside the crate don't need to build these directly; the
/// retry loop drives the schedule internally.  The type is
/// public for tests and observability tools that want to
/// inspect the computed delay.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use swe_edge_egress_grpc_retry::BackoffSchedule;
///
/// let schedule = BackoffSchedule::from_duration(Duration::from_millis(200));
/// assert_eq!(schedule.sleep, Duration::from_millis(200));
/// ```
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct BackoffSchedule {
    /// How long to sleep before the next retry.
    pub sleep: Duration,
}

impl BackoffSchedule {
    /// Wrap a [`Duration`] as a [`BackoffSchedule`].
    pub fn from_duration(sleep: Duration) -> Self {
        Self { sleep }
    }
}
